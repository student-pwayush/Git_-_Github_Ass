In present we can work with help of git GitHub, GitHub is a cloud-based service that hosts a version control system (VCS) called Git. It allows developers to collaborate and make changes to shared projects while keeping detailed track of their progress.


(A) Code reviews: GitHub makes it easy for developers to review each other's code. This helps to improve the quality of the code and to identify potential bugs.

(B) Creating & Issues: GitHub provides a way for developers to track issues and tasks related to their code. This helps teams to stay organized and to prioritize their work.

(C) conclusion: GitHub provides a way for developers to discuss their code and ask questions. This helps to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing.

(E) Branches and pull requests: GitHub makes it easy for developers to create and manage branches of their.

(G) Code commands . This allows developers to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase. Once a developer is ready to merge their changes back into the main codebase, they can create a pull request. This allows other developers to review the changes and provide feedback before they are merged.
